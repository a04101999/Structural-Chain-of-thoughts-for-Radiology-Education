Based on these differences, please analyze and reason through the findings to generate a JSON response that reflects the nature of the discrepancies.

        - "No Missing Subgraph": Set this to 1 if there are no missing subgraphs in the list. Otherwise, set it to 0.
        - "Missing Subgraph due to Missing fixation": Set to 1 if there are any missing fixation points, otherwise set it to 0.
        - "Missing Subgraph due to reduced fixation duration": Set to 1 if any fixation duration is shorter than expected, otherwise set it to 0.
        - "Missing Subgraph due to undefined reason": Set to 1 only if there are missing subgraphs with no clear reason (i.e., no missing fixation points or reduced durations). Set it to 0 if there are clear reasons (such as missing fixation points or reduced durations).
        
        Please provide your reasoning for each point before returning the JSON response.
